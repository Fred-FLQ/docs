Generally most of site need code button and syntax highlighter. By default AnsPress sanitize and preserve code in question and answer, but code button and syntax highlighter is not there by default. To get this enabled you have to follow below steps:

1. Install [Crayon Syntax Highlighter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/) plugin and activate it. Go to http://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=crayon_settings.
2. Find **Decode HTML entities in code** and check checkbox.
3. Find **Display the Tag Editor in any TinyMCE instances on the frontend (e.g. bbPress)** check checkbox.
4. Find **Display Tag Editor settings on the frontend** uncheck checkbox.
5. And finally save the option.

After completing above steps you can see code button in ask and answer form. Let us know if need more help http://anspress.io/questions/ask/
